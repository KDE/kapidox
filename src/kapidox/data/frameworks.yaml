intro:
    - This is the online reference for developing with the KDE frameworks.
    - The KDE Frameworks build on the <a href="http://qt-project.org">Qt
      framework</a>, providing everything from simple utility classes (such as
      those in KCoreAddons) to integrated solutions for common requirements of
      desktop applications (such as KNewStuff, for fetching downloadable add-on
      content in an application, or the powerful KIO multi-protocol file access
      framework).
    - The KDE Frameworks can be used in CMake-based and QMake-based projects,
      and most of them are portable to at least Windows, Mac and Linux. The
      documentation of each framework has code snippets that show how to include
      the framework in a QMake or CMake project.
    - The frameworks are divided into four tiers, based on the kind of
      dependencies that they have. For instance, Tier 1 frameworks depend on Qt
      and possibly some third-party libraries, but not on other frameworks. This
      makes them easy to integrate into existing applications.

tiers:
    1: Tier 1 frameworks depend only on Qt (and possibly a small number of other
       third-party libraries), so can easily be used by an Qt-based project.

    2: Tier 2 frameworks additionally depend on tier 1 frameworks, but still have
       easily manageable dependencies.

    3: Tier 3 frameworks are generally more powerful, comprehensive packages, and
       consequently have more complex dependencies.

    4: Tier 4 frameworks can be mostly ignored by application programmers; this
       tier consists of plugins acting behind the scenes to provide additional
       functionality or platform integration to existing frameworks (including Qt).
