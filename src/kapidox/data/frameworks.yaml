intro:
    - This is the online reference for developing with the KDE frameworks.
    - The KDE Frameworks build on the <a href="http://qt-project.org">Qt
      framework</a>, providing everything from simple utility classes (such as
      those in KCoreAddons) to integrated solutions for common requirements of
      desktop applications (such as KNewStuff, for fetching downloadable add-on
      content in an application, or the powerful KIO multi-protocol file access
      framework).
    - The frameworks are divided into four tiers.

tiers:
    1: Tier 1 frameworks depend only on Qt (and possibly a small number of other
       third-party libraries), so can easily be used by an Qt-based project.

    2: Tier 2 frameworks additionally depend on tier 1 frameworks, but still have
       easily manageable dependencies.

    3: Tier 3 frameworks are generally more powerful, comprehensive packages, and
       consequently have more complex dependencies.

    4: Tier 4 frameworks can be mostly ignored by application programmers; this
       tier consists of plugins acting behind the scenes to provide additional
       functionality or platform integration to existing frameworks (including Qt).
