# Description of the metainfo.yml syntax {#metainfo_syntax}
The name is the folder name.
The fancyname is the project name used in CMake.

Each group must contain one and only one library with the `group_info` block. If
more are defined, the behavior is unknown.

**Be sure to to set `public_lib` to true, or the library will be ignored.** Most of
the other keys are optionals. See below for a simplier example.

## All possible keys.

    - The KDE Frameworks build on the <a href="https://www.qt.io">Qt
      framework</a>, providing everything from simple utility classes (such as
      those in KCoreAddons) to integrated solutions for common requirements of
      desktop applications (such as KNewStuff, for fetching downloadable add-on
      content in an application, or the powerful KIO multi-protocol file access
      framework).

  subgroups: # every subgroup must be declared here or will be ignored
    - name: Tier 1
      description: Tier 1 frameworks depend only on Qt (and possibly a small number of other third-party libraries), so can easily be used by an Qt-based project.
    - name: Tier 2
      description: Tier 2 frameworks additionally depend on tier 1 frameworks, but still have easily manageable dependencies.

## Simple example 1

In this case, the library is not part of a group, and the source is in `src`. If
there is no logo, a default one is used.

~~~{.yaml}
description: Library doing X
maintainer: ochurlaud
public_lib: true
logo: libX.png
~~~

## Simple example 2

In this case, the libraries X and Y are part of the same group `XY`, and the
source is in `src`.

### libX

~~~{.yaml}
description: Library doing X
maintainer: ochurlaud
public_lib: true
platforms:
  - name: Linux
  - name: Windows
    note: doesn't work with Windows10
group: XY

    - Windows (partial)

### libY
