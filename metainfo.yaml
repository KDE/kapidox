    description: Providing everything from simple utility classes to integrated solutions for common requirements of desktop applications
    logo: konqi_frameworks.png
    long_description:
        - The KDE Frameworks build on the <a href="http://qt-project.org">Qt
          framework</a>, providing everything from simple utility classes (such as
          those in KCoreAddons) to integrated solutions for common requirements of
          desktop applications (such as KNewStuff, for fetching downloadable add-on
          content in an application, or the powerful KIO multi-protocol file access
          framework).
        - The KDE Frameworks can be used in CMake-based and QMake-based projects,
          and most of them are portable to at least Windows, Mac and Linux. The
          documentation of each framework has code snippets that show how to include
          the framework in a QMake or CMake project.
        - The frameworks are divided into four tiers, based on the kind of
          dependencies that they have. For instance, Tier 1 frameworks depend on Qt
          and possibly some third-party libraries, but not on other frameworks. This
          makes them easy to integrate into existing applications.
    subgroups:
        - name: Tier 1
          order: 1
          description: Tier 1 frameworks depend only on Qt (and possibly a small number of other third-party libraries), so can easily be used by any Qt-based project.
        - name: Tier 2
          order: 2
          description: Tier 2 frameworks additionally depend on tier 1 frameworks, but still have easily manageable dependencies.
        - name: Tier 3
          order: 3
          description: Tier 3 frameworks are generally more powerful, comprehensive packages, and consequently have more complex dependencies.
        - name: Tier 4
          order: 4
          description: Tier 4 frameworks can be mostly ignored by application programmers; this tier consists of plugins acting behind the scenes to provide additional functionality or platform integration to existing frameworks (including Qt).
        - name: Porting Aids
          order: 5
          description: Porting Aids frameworks provide code and utilities to ease the transition from kdelibs 4 to KDE Frameworks 5. Code should aim to port away from this framework, new projects should avoid using these libraries.
